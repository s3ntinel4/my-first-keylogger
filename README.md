# My first keylogger

My very first keylogger project writen in python, the idea behind it came from [cybercademy].

[cybercademy]: https://cybercademy.org/build-advanced-keylogger-in-python-project-overview/

To execute the .py file, first you need to install the modules used via pip.

Make sure you have pip installed.

To install the modules needed you can use the following syntax:
```
pip install platform psutil json logging ifaddr pyautogui threading pynput
```

Also for the screenshot function you need to install scrot.
```
sudo apt-get install scrot
```

Then after you have the modules installed and the apps needed, you can execute the python executable with:
```
python3 keylogger_project.py
```
