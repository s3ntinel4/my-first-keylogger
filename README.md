# my-first-keylogger
My very first keylogger project, the idea behind it came from [cybercademy].

[cybercademy]: https://cybercademy.org/build-advanced-keylogger-in-python-project-overview/

To execute the .py file, first you need to install the modules used via pip.

Make sure you have pip installed.

To install the modules needed you can use the following syntax:
```
pip install platform psutil json logging ifaddr pyautogui threading pynput
```
